# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch
An Etch-a-Sketch web project created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

After finishing this web project, I learned a handful of new knowledge in utilizing event listeners, string manipulation, and DOM manipulation. The project is quite difficult, especially tackling the extra credit challenge like the progressive darkening effect. It took me hours of trial and error until I have landed on a solution. Creating and accomplishing this web project was
a fun journey as I was able to take what I had learned from the lessons and used them to build this Etch-a-Sketch webpage.

Thank you The Odin Project!
